    <h1>French Toast</h1>
    <img src="../images/french-toast.jpg"><br>
        <p>
            Brioche and challah bread make the best French toach. Both are already so eggy that once 
            dipped in the batter and griddled in butter they become custard-like on the inside. The 
            nicely browned and caramelized outside is thanks in part to the added sugar in the egg 
            mixture. And playing with the flavor is easy: This recipe has a touch of warmth from 
            cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnanmon</li>
            <li>&frac14; teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>&frac14; cup milk</li>
            <li>&frac12; teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>8 slices challah, brioche, or white bread</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine cinnamon, nutmeg, and sugar and set aside briefly.</li><br>
            <li>
                In a skillet or on a griddle, melt butter over medium heat. Whisk together cinnamon mixture, 
                eggs, milk, and vanilla and pour into a shallow container such as a pie plate. Dip bread in 
                egg mixture. Fry slices until golden brown, then flip to cook the other side. Serve with syrup.
            </li>
        </ol>
    
    <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>
            Make sure you don't over-soak the bread. Fully submerge it in the batter for only a few seconds and let 
            any excess drip off before cooking. And wait for the bubbles from the melted butter to subside - 
            that's when you know your pan is hot enough.
