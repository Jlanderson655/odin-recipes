        </ul>

        <h4>For the cream cheese frosting:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>4 oz cream cheese, <em>softened</em></li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, <em>softened</em></li>
            <li>&frac34; cup powdered sugar</li>
            <li>&frac12; teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Warm milk to around 110&deg; F. This can be done by placing in a microwave for 40-45 seconds.
                It should be like warm bath water. Transfer warm milk to the bowl of an electric mixer and sprinkle
                yeast on top. Add in sugar, egg, egg yolk and melted butter. Mix until well combined. Next stir in
                flour and salt with a wooden spoon until a dough begins to form.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Place dough hook on stand mixer and knead dough on medium speed for 8 minutes. Dough should form into
                a nice ball and be slightly sticky. If it's too sticky (meaning it's sticking to the bottom of the mixer)
                add 2 tablespoons more bread flour. If you don't want to use an electric mixer, you can use your hands to
                knead the dough for 8-10 minutes on a well-floured surface.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Transfer dough ball to a well-oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and a warm towl. Allow dough to rise for 
                1 hour to 1 &frac12; hours, or until doubled in size. This may need more or less time depending on the 
                humidity and temperature in your home.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                After dough has doubled in size, transfer dough to a well-floured surfacer and roll out into a 14x9 inch rectangle. 
                Spread softened butter over dough, leaving a &frac14; inch margin at the far side of the dough.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                In a small bowl, mix together brown sugar and cinnamon. Use your hands to sprikle mixture over the buttered 
                dough, then rub the brown sugar mixture into the butter.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Tightly roll dough up, starting from the 9-inch side and place seam side down making sure to seal the edges 
                of the dough as best you can. You will probably need to cut off about an inch off the ends of the dough as the 
                ends won't be as full of cinnamon sugar as we'd want it to be.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cut into 1 inch sections with a serrated knife or floss. You should get 9 large pieces.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Place cinnamon rolls in a greased 9x9 inch baking pan or rough 9 inch cake pan. (I also recommend lining the pan 
                with parchment paper as well, in case any of the filling ends up leaking out.) Cover with plastic wrap and a warm 
                towl and let rise again for 30-45 minutes.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 350&deg; F. Remove plastic wrap and towl and bake cinnamon rolls for 20-25 minutes or until just 
                slightly golden brown on the edges. You want to underbake them a little so they stay soft in the middle, that's why 
                we want them just slightly golden brown. Allow them to cool for 5-10 minutes before frosting. Makes 9 cinnanmon rolls.
            </li><br>
            <li><b>To make the frosting:</b> In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar and vanilla 
            extract. Beat until smooth and fluffy. Spread over cinnamon rolls and serve immediately. Enjoy!
            </li>
        </ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
        <h4>To make overnight cinnamon rolls:</h4>
            <p>
                After placing rolls into the greased pan (after the first rise), simply cover, place overnight in the fridge and then bake 
                them in the morning as directed. I like to bring the cinnamon rolls to room temperature first by leaving them on the counter 
                for 30-45 minutes before baking (this is known as the second rise).
